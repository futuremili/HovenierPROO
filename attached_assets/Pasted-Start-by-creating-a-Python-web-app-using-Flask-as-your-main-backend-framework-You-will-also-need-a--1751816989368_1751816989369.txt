Start by creating a Python web app using Flask as your main backend framework. You will also need a database, preferably SQLite for simplicity inside Replit, or PostgreSQL if you want to scale later. First set up your Flask app and configure user authentication with email and phone verification (2-step verification). You can use Flask-Login for handling user sessions and authentication and use libraries like Flask-Mail for email verification and Twilio for SMS codes. When users sign up, they should enter their name, email, phone number, profile picture, and password. After submitting, you send a verification email and a verification SMS code. Once verified, they can log in. After login, direct them to the home screen dashboard which displays todayâ€™s tasks, with task titles, time slots, locations, assigned team members, and task statuses ("To Do", "In Progress", or "Done"). Include a section showing all team members who are working today, with names, profile photos, emails, and phone numbers. There should be a notification bell icon that shows a red dot or number when there is a new task or a new chat message; clicking it removes the dot. Allow users to create tasks from a task screen by entering title, description, location, who should do it, and time. When a task is created, update the home screen immediately for everyone in the same team. Tasks that are finished move automatically to a history tab the next day; if not finished, they stay until marked done. Users can mark tasks as "To Do", "In Progress", or "Done" interactively. Add a chat system that works for team-wide messages (group chat) and also private 1:1 chats between coworkers; these chats should update live for all logged-in users. Create a team overview screen where you can see all team members' details and online status. Add a settings screen where users can edit personal details (name, email, phone, profile photo), enable dark mode, access a help center, and view a user manual ("handleiding"). Create a profile screen where they can edit their own profile info and see their profile photo. Build a system for company "circles" using unique codes: when a manager creates an account, they receive a unique code that they give to coworkers, who enter this code on signup to join that private company circle. Different company circles must be completely separated so no data is shared between different companies. Include a first-time onboarding walkthrough screen after signup explaining how to add tasks, how to mark tasks as done, how to chat, and how to navigate the app, so that users understand it immediately. Add functionality for users to log work hours, sick days, vacation days, and normal work days off, and make sure this data is saved permanently and visible in the app after logout and login again. Design the app with a clean, modern look using a lot of white space, green accents (to match landscaping), rounded corners, and large readable text. Avoid clutter and keep it simple. Add extra features to make it special, like push notifications (optional), a calendar view for tasks, and an activity summary for managers showing hours worked, days off, and active tasks. Show online or offline status next to each user's name in the team screen and chat screen. Throughout, make sure all user data is saved in the database and always updates live across all devices logged in, so nothing disappears after logout. Use Flask templates (Jinja2) for frontend pages and style them with CSS (optionally with a framework like Bootstrap for faster design). Connect the frontend forms and buttons to Flask routes so adding tasks, updating statuses, sending messages, and editing profiles all work seamlessly. Finally, rigorously test each feature (signup, login, verification, tasks, chat, notifications, settings, profile, manager codes, company circles, data persistence) to ensure that everything works perfectly without losing data or showing outdated info. Once all of this is done, your app will be a fully working modern, smooth, professional system for hoveniers in the Netherlands, called HovenierPRO.
